This page is an attempt to make simple math games for kids using JavaScript. The idea is to see the extend of JavaScript when it comes to mathematical problems.

## Games:
    1. Test Game 1.


### Test Game 1:
This Game is just a test game to see if this can be implemented in github. I followed a project by ['LearnWebCode'](https://codepen.io/learnwebcode/pen/mdPMBjL) to make life easier. This games generates random questions and the user has to answer them to get points, if they make 3 mistakes the game is lost on the other hand, if they get 10 right answers they win.

#### Test Game 1 status:
   - [x] html
   - [ ] JavaScript
   - [ ] css

##### Things left to work on
    - progress bars
    - CSS
    - UX(auto-select and auto-erase)
